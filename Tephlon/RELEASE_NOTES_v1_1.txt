=== About Tephlon 
Tephlon is a multi-driver (for now just file cache) PHP library that adds a persistence 
layer to your PHP objects, arrays or variables.
It's mainly file based, but adding a new driver for other kind of internal/external 
storage is really simple.

It is also very easy to integrate as an external library in popular PHP frameworks 
like Codeigniter. Please visit Tephlon home page to see examples and documentation
about this topic.

=== Anatomy 
Tephlon is composed of two parts:
* Tephlon Core: the real key-value multidriver storage engine
* Tephlon DS: a set of ready data structures (TMap, TBuffer, TCounter, etc) built on
top of Tephlon Core and ready to be extended by your application specific data models.

=== Tephlon core feature list
- Key-Value full serialization to file storage
- Generic atomic operations (synchronization on a Record)
- Specify a default lifetime (for each Resource)
- Specify a lifetime (for each Record)

=== Tephlon DS (data structures)
- TMap: Resambles Java Map interface
- TBuffer_FIFO/TBuffer_LIFO: TBuffer contains a time-ordered list of values 
  (not key-values as in TMap).
  It also let you specify the maximum size of the buffer, so that if you insert
  the size+1'th element, the buffer will discard the oldest (FIFO) or the newest
  (LIFO).
 - TCounter: A simple synchronized counter. For example you can make a concurrency
