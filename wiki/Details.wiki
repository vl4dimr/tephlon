#summary Tephlon explained more in detail.


<div class="description">
<h2>Tephlon: persistent storage library in PHP for PHP.</h2>
<strong>Tephlon</strong> is a library intended to <strong>simplify</strong>and 
<strong>speed up</strong> development of modern web applications in PHP.
The advantages of preferring Tephlon to SQL based external RDBMS have much bigger 
extent than simply reduce the amount of code in your web application.
As we\'ll see, <strong>mainainance </strong>of code and the <strong>backup </strong>
of whole production data will become also way easier.
<h2>Why will I code websites faster?</h2>
With Tephlon business logic and data will speak the same language. Thus, all Object-Relational 
mapping (ORM) code becomes totally unnecessary.
<h2> Comparing storage architectures </h2>
It\'s interesting to compare Tephlon with the"traditional" LAMP style website programming.
Before Tephlon, you had to go pre-think all the static DB schema before even starting implementing
any feature. You needed to decide not just the types of the data but also how many characters they
can ever be long. This again everytime you want to add a feature.
<p>Let\'s have a look in detail: <strong>in white the parts of code to create 
everytime from scratch.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Traditional PHP-RDBMS architecture</h3>
<div class="description_image"><img src="http://codesigner.eu/tephlon/assets/image/PHP-ORM-RDBMS-schema.jpg" /> 
<p>Traditional architecture (PHP + MySQL or other RDBMS)</p>
</div>
<strong>Business logic</strong> (PHP objects, classes, methods..) will need 
<strong>ORM logic </strong>(other PHP code) to typically translate classes to tables,
objects to tuples and actions (methods) to queries).
Once the data and the actions on them "will speak SQL", <strong> RDBMS</strong> can 
finally store data into its static schema with its rigid data types.

<h3>Architecture with external NoSQL (PHP+Redis or similar)</h3>
Business logic will be now able to store an approximate version of the untranslated 
objects to the external NoSQL dynamic schema database. Unfortunately the DB won\'t save 
a lot of information about objects: field was private, protected or public? Who\'s it\'s 
superclass? And where are all the methods? All lost.
Of course we could use easily REDIS to implement a storage driver (now just filesystem driver
is ready and performs quite well). In that case we could leverage Redis\' speed and replication
features, but it\'s complicated, backup of data is a pain, and you need an expensive
hosting account. The key of Tephlon is the "fast development" approach, so for now REDIS driver
is really a low priority thing.
<h3>Tephlon architecture</h3>
<div class="description_image"><img src="http://codesigner.eu/tephlon/assets/image/PHP-TEPHLON-schema.jpg" /> 
<p>Tephlon architecture</p>
</div>
Business logic will extend or simply instantiate and use a Tephlon class to obtain 
a Resource, give it the object/variable/array which needs to be stored together with 
its label. Next time logic will retrieve the object it will be exactly identical. 
Methods, fields, class information included.
<blockquote>That\'s so simple, Tephlon just gets rid of any overhead between 
PHP business logic and the data.</blockquote>
Tephlon is fully aware of what PHP\'s objects, arrays, or dynamically typed variables 
are and makes them persistently stored. That\'s because Tephlon is a piece of PHP code itself.

<h2>No tables or columns? Then what?</h2>
Tephlon is built on top of two alternative - way more flexible - main concepts:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Resource</strong>:
A Resource is a container of Records and it\'s identified by a "Resource Label".</li>
    <li><strong>Record</strong>:
A Record is the representation of a piece of data of any shape (object, variable, boolean).
Each record belongs to a Resource, and it\'s identified by a "Record Label".</li>
</ul>
