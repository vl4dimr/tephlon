<h1>Rapid prototyping</h1>
<p>
As your PHP project takes shape, your data types will get refactored many times.<br>
At the same time, also their representation into the DB will change.<br>
It's a natural process of evolution of a work in progress, nothing bad about it.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>BUT</strong> what typically happens is that soon you'll end up with lots of time and focus lost to update your Object to Relational Mapping (ORM) code, and a weak DB schema, visibly afterthought, and touched many times.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tephlon provides a simple interface to store your data types <strong>as objects</strong> directly. However, you can store in the same Resource (a Tephlon data store) any other primitive variables such as strings, booleans or integers.<br>
</p>
<p>
With Tephlon you can postpone the SQL schema and ORM code design to the moment in which the data structure will be definitive.<br>
Enables to produce functional website prototypes without a line of SQL<br>
